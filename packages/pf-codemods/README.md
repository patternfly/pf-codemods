# pf-codemods

**We have not officially released this package yet. It will officially be released with 4.x.x.**

Hey PatternFly-React devs! `pf-codemods` is an eslint wrapper to update @patternfly/react-core@3.x.x code to 4.x.x. I hope these rules and their autofixers will help you more quickly adopt our breaking changes. These rules are not designed to fix all build errors, but they can help to fix easy ones.

These rules are based off the breaking change notes for React. Each rule links the breaking change patternfly-react PR in case you want to better understand the change.
