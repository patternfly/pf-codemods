### loginMainFooterLinksItem-structure-updated [(#10107)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/pull/10107)

LoginMainFooterLinksItem structure has changed. Instead of passing it many properties, everything is now passed in a children component directly.

#### Examples

In:

```jsx
%inputExample%
```

Out:

```jsx
%outputExample%
```
