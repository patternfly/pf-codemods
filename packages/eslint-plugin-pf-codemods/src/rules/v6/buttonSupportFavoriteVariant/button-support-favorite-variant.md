### button-support-favorite-variant [(#11853)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/pull/11853)

This rule detects when you're using `StarIcon` with Button components and suggests using the new `isFavorite` and `isFavorited` props instead. This supports the new favorite variant that includes animation styling.

#### Examples

In:

```jsx
%inputExample%
```

Out:

```jsx
%outputExample%
```
