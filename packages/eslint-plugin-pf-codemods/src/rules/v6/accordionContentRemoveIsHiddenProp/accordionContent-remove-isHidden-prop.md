### accordionContent-remove-isHidden-prop [(#9876)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/pull/9876)

The `isHidden` prop has been removed from AccordionContent, as its visibility will now be set automatically based on the `isExpanded` prop on AccordionItem.

#### Examples

In:

```jsx
%inputExample%
```

Out:

```jsx
%outputExample%
```
