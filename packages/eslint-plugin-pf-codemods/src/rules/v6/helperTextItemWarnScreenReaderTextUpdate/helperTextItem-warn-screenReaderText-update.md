### helperTextItem-warn-screenReaderText-update [(#10029)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/pull/10029)

The `screenReaderText` prop on HelperTextItem has been updated, and will now render only when the `variant` prop has a value other than "default". Previously the prop was rendered only when the `isDynamic` prop was true.
