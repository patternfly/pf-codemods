### emptyState-nonExported-components [(#10364)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/pull/10364)

EmptyStateHeader and EmptyStateIcon are no longer exported by PatternFly. This rule will only apply fixes for exports of these components, as our rule for unused imports will handle applying fixes for imports.

#### Examples

In:

```jsx
%inputExample%
```

Out:

```jsx
%outputExample%
```
