### dualListSelector-deprecated [(#10359)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/pull/10359)

Our previous implementation of DualListSelector has been deprecated. This rule will update import paths to our deprecated directory, but we recommend using our newly promoted implementation.

#### Examples

In:

```jsx
%inputExample%
```

Out:

```jsx
%outputExample%
```
