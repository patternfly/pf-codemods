### toolbarLabelGroupContent-updated-markup [(#10674)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/pull/10674)

The markup for ToolbarLabelGruopContent (formerly ToolbarChipGroupContent) has changed when the `numberOfFilters` value is greater than 0, when the `showClearFiltersButton` prop is true, or when the `customLabelGroupContent` prop is passed. This rule will not provide a fix, but will throw a warning.
