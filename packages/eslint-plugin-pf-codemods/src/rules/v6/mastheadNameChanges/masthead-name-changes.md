### masthead-name-changes [(#10809)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/pull/10809)

Our old implementation of `MastheadBrand` has been renamed to `MastheadLogo`, which must be wrapped by our new implementation of `MastheadBrand`."

This rule will handle the renaming, required restructuring will be handled under a separate rule.

#### Examples

In:

```jsx
%inputExample%
```

Out:

```jsx
%outputExample%
```
