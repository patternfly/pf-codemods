### jumpLinksItem-warn-href-required [(#10027)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/pull/10027)

The `href` prop on JumpLinksItem is now required. Additionally, the markup for JumpLinksItem and the typing of the `onClick` property has been updated as it now uses our Button component internally.
