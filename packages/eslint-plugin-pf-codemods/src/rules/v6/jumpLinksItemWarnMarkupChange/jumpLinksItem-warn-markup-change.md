### jumpLinksItem-warn-markup-change [(#10027)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/pull/10027)

The markup for JumpLinksItem has changed, as it now uses our Button component internally. Additionally, the `onClick` prop type has been updated to just `React.MouseEvent` (previously `React.MouseEvent<HTMLAnchorElement>`).
