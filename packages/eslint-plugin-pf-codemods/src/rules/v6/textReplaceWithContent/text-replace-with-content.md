### text-replace-with-content [(#10643)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/pull/10643)

We have replaced Text, TextContent, TextList and TextListItem with one Content component. Running this fix will change all of those components names to Content and add a "component" prop where necessary.

#### Examples

In:

```jsx
%inputExample%
```

Out:

```jsx
%outputExample%
```
