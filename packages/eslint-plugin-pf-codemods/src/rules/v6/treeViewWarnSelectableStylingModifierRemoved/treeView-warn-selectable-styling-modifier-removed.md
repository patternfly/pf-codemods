### treeView-warn-selectable-styling-modifier-removed [(#10101)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/pull/10101)

Selectable styling attribute (`pf-m-selectable`) has been removed on the list items of the TreeView component. You should update selectors, tests and snapshot tests which are relying on the `pf-m-selectable` class.
